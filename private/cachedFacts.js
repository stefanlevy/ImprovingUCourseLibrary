As developers, we started with tables, then graduated to floats and positioning, and then to grid systems. The mobile internet introduced even more complexity in our layout world, adding in media queries, polyfills, etc. In 2011, the W3C CSS committee introduced the flexbox specification, meant to allow for fully flexible horizontal and vertical layout management that works logically in multiple resolutions, without media queries. 4 years later, flexbox is finally becoming a mainstream solution. However, it isn't simple to use--there are undocumented 'quirks' that will frustrate even the most experienced CSS expert. Mike Earley has been using CSS Flexbox in a variety commercial applications for over 3 years. He has successfully implemented it in applications that were already using alternative layout systems, and has also built an application's layout structure using flexbox from the start. The session will cover the basics of the various flexbox properties, and then delve into detailed layouts involving flexbox--i.e. a full administration application's layout.

However, Autodesk has released a high quality low(or even free) cost 3D parametric CAD package: Fusion 360\n\nWhat is 3D parametric CAD? It’s a form of modeling where you create templates or sketch of profiles that are dimensioned, and then extruded, cut and merge the models from the sketches. When you need to change a dimension, you go back to the sketch and change the parameter, and the model will update accordingly. This makes working and reworking designs much easier then with traditional approaches.  \n\nThis class will introduce 3D CAD, Fusion 360, and walk the student through creating a model. Additional topics include: Joints, Constraints, Stress Analysis and CAM. Time and interest permitting.  Some real world examples will be brought in showing some parts that the instructor made starting with 3D CAM.     \n\nApproach: Guided labs with discussion.\n","prior":[],"_in":{"id":18,"hash":-879851026}}},{"type":"fact","id":786,"fact":{"type":"ImprovingU.Course.Abstract","from":{"id":2,"hash":-209558701},"course":{"id":146,"hash":600668804},"value":"Location: Calgary Office \n\nDate: TBD \n\nTime: TBD - 1 session 90 minutes \n\nAn Introduction to Microservices Architecture - This session will provide an overview of how microservice applications are composed, what they are good for, and how Azure services (such as Service Fabric) can be used to build them.
