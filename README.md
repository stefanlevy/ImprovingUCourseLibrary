# ImprovingU

Course survey site

## Background

ImprovingU is a series of courses taught by Improvers for Improvers (that is, people who work at [Improving](http://improving.com). This is a site created with [Jinaga](http://jinaga.com) to survey Improvers on courses they would like to take or teach.

## Requirements

* Node 5.0.0
* Mongo 3.0.0

## Installation

Clone the repository. Run `npm install`. Start a Mongo server on the local machine, or configure the application to use a different instance.

## Walkthrough

The application was created using these steps:

Create an empty directory and initialize a Node application using `npm init`. Also initialize a Git repository using `git init`.

Install Bower with `npm install -save bower`. Initialize it with `bower init` and select the "globals" package style.

Install Bootstrap with `bower install -save bootstrap`.
